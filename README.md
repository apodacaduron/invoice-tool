# Invoice Tool

**Invoice Tool** is a lightweight, client-side invoice generator designed to help you create, preview, and download invoices as PDFs. It’s a simple tool for freelancers, small businesses, or anyone who needs to generate simple invoices quickly.

## 🌐 DEMO

The app is live at [invoicetool.netlify.app](https://invoicetool.netlify.app/).

## 🚀 Features
- **Client-Side Only**: This app runs entirely in the browser. We do **not store** any data on a server.
- **PDF Export**: Generate and download invoices in PDF format.
- **Data Stored Locally**: All data is stored locally in your browser during your session, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source, allowing for customization and contributions.

## 🔐 Data Privacy

- **No Data is Sent to a Server**: Since this is a client-side application, none of your data is ever transmitted or stored on any external server. All invoice information remains securely in your browser and is cleared when you close the tab or refresh the page.
  
- **Local Storage Only**: If needed, the app may use browser local storage for persisting data between page refreshes. You have full control over this data, and it can be easily cleared by clearing your browser storage.

## 📅 Future Features

We are considering adding the following features in future releases:
- **Cloud Storage**: Optional cloud storage for saving and accessing invoices across devices.
- **User Authentication**: Support for logins to sync and manage invoices in the cloud.
