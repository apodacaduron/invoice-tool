## 💡 Why I built it
I made Invoice Tool after getting frustrated with invoicing services that limited free users to just a few invoices.  
All I needed as a freelance developer was a simple way to send weekly invoices to clients in the US and Portugal — without paying for features I didn’t need.  
So I built this tool for myself, and now I’m sharing it for anyone who wants something lightweight that just works.
